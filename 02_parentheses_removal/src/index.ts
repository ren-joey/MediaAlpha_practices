/**
 *
 * Parentheses removal function. Given a string containing an expression, return the expression with unnecessary parentheses removed.
 *     For example:
 *     f("1*(2+(3*(4+5)))") ===> "1*(2+3*(4+5))"
 *     f("2 + (3 / -5)") ===> "2 + 3 / -5"
 *     f("x+(y+z)+(t+(v+w))") ===> "x+y+z+t+v+w"
 *
 * Please write a function that removes unnecessary parenthesis for any given string. You can write this in any language but please provide it in an executable format with instructions.
 *
 * You could just attach the code into an email or any other way that is convenient for you and please provide unit testing functionality. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the programming questions.
 *
 * @param expression
 * @returns
